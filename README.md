# devsetup
General setup for my dev workstation preferences.

This is a scripted installation of a collection of tools, preferences, and settings I prefer to use on my development workstations.

This script is meant to be used with, and has only been tested on, Ubuntu (20.04). It may work on other distributions but I have no intention of testing or planning for them.
